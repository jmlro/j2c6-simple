Well, hello there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Ian (aka ian-s-mcb) and this is my little
corner of the web.

This site serves three purposes:
1. to show that I *do* exist, despite my abstenance of most social
networks
1. to document my portfolio projects
1. to give me a platform to comment on the topics I encounter as an
engineer

My technical interests include:
* Full-stack web development
* Microservice architectures
* Linux

Given that my name isn't that uncommon, I ought to point out which "Ian"
is me.

* I am a thirty-something year old denizen of New York City. I commute
  into the city, so unfortunately, I'm not a bona fide New Yorker.
* I grew up in the village of Rye Brook, in Westchester County, New
  York, USA. You're forgiven for never hearing of it. It's quite the
  unremarkable place, other than its size (too small to have its own
  post office) and its location (~50 minutes by train from the nearest
  civilization, NYC).
* I ride a gray and orange Tern folding bicycle on the streets of
  Westchester, Manhattan, and Brooklyn. With my 6' 4" height (194 cm)
  and my 20" wheels, I strongly resemble a circus bear on a bicycle, but
  please don't laugh.
* In 2021, I completed a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer
  Science at [The City College of New York][ccny] (which is one of the
  CUNY campuses). College wasn't especially kind on me (my tour of duty
  lasted longer than most PhD programs). But I got through it, mostly
  intact. I'm bald now, but the beard grows on!
